 Write an Infrastructure as code using terraform, which automatically create a VPC.
 In that VPC we have to create 2 subnets:

  a.  public subnet 

  b.  private subnet 
 Create a public facing internet gateway for connect our VPC/Network to the internet world and attach this gateway to our VPC.

 Create a routing table for Internet gateway so that instance can connect to outside world, update and associate it with public subnet.
 Update the routing table of the private subnet, so that to access the internet it uses the nat gateway created in the public subnet
 Launch a web server into the Public subnet
 Launch a database server into the Private subnet
Log into the webserver and ping google.com. You should get a response.
ping google.com
 Next try and ping the database server. You should get response too.
ping 10.0.2.5
Create a NAT gateway for connect our VPC/Network to the internet world and attach this gateway to our VPC in the public network
Now try and ping google.com from your database server.
